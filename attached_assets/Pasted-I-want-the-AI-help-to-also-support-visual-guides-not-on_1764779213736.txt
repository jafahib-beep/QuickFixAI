I want the AI help to also support visual guides, not only text.

Please extend the AI backend and the Search/AI UI so that AI can propose and deliver guide images for a problem.

Requirements:

1) Backend: AI + images
   - In the existing OpenAI backend route for AI guides, add an option to request an "image guide".
   - For a given user query (e.g. "fix a leaking faucet"), do the following:
     a) First, generate a structured text guide (3–7 numbered steps) as we already planned.
     b) Then, generate 2–4 image prompts that correspond to the key steps (for example:
        - "Turn off the water valve under the sink"
        - "Remove the faucet handle"
        - "Replace the rubber washer"
        - "Turn the water back on and check for leaks")
     c) Use the OpenAI Images API (or compatible image generation API) to generate guide images based on those prompts.
     d) Return both:
        - the text steps
        - an array of image URLs with a short caption for each one.

   - Make sure the backend never exposes the raw API key to the client; all image generation must be done server-side.

2) Frontend: Search + AI Guide UI
   - In the AI guide card on the Search screen:
     a) Show the text steps first.
     b) Add an option like "Show image guide" or automatically show the images below the steps if they exist.
     c) Display the images in a simple horizontal scroll or grid, with their captions.
   - Ensure the AI guide (text + images) can be saved to the Toolbox:
     - When saving an AI guide, include both the text steps and the image URLs so that the user can revisit them later.

3) UX details:
   - When the AI is generating images, show a small loading state like "Generating image guide..." so the user knows it's working.
   - If image generation fails for some reason, still show the text steps and a friendly note like "Image guide not available right now."

4) Multi-language:
   - The AI text steps should be generated in the user’s selected app language (EN, SV, AR, DE, FR, RU) if possible.
   - Captions for the images should follow the same language as the text guide.

The goal:
- Users can type any problem.
- They get a step-by-step AI text guide.
- They can also see 2–4 simple guide images generated by AI that visually explain the steps.
- The entire AI guide (text + images) can be saved in the Toolbox.
