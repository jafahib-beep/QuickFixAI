TASK: Perform UI cleanup, fix LiveAssist camera loading bug, fix AI Chat 404 error, and stabilize the entire app. Follow the steps in exact order.

----------------------------------------------------
1. MOBILE UI CLEANUP (Home, AI Chat, LiveAssist)
----------------------------------------------------

Goal: Make the mobile UI look polished, modern, and App Store–quality.

- Improve spacing, padding, margins, and layout consistency.
- Make typography consistent across all screens.
- Apply modern card styles with smooth rounded corners and subtle shadows.
- Fix layout issues on:
  • HomeScreen
  • AIChatScreen
  • LiveAssistScreen
- Ensure all screens look clean and professional in mobile preview.

----------------------------------------------------
2. FIX LIVEASSIST CAMERA LOADING BUG
----------------------------------------------------

Problem: LiveAssist works with uploaded images but hangs when using camera.

Required fixes:

1. Review and correct ImagePicker logic:
   - Ensure both launchCameraAsync and launchImageLibraryAsync return usable base64 data.
2. Ensure imageBase64 is ALWAYS included in the request body.
3. Add debugging logs for:
   - base64 length
   - request payload size
   - fetch error messages
4. Auto-compress large images (quality: 0.7).
5. Guarantee that /api/ai/liveassist ALWAYS returns a response.
6. Validate successful operation:
   - Camera → works
   - Gallery → works
   - No infinite loading spinner.

----------------------------------------------------
3. FIX AI CHAT 404 ERROR (BACKEND ROUTE)
----------------------------------------------------

Goal: Make AI Chat functional using the mock response until the final AI backend is ready.

Steps:

1. Verify /api/ai/chat is implemented and exported correctly.
2. Ensure aiRoutes is properly imported and registered in backend/index.js.
3. Disable or remove all checkAIServiceHealth code on both frontend and backend.
4. Fix API_BASE_URL so the mobile app calls the correct backend (no localhost).
5. Add logs in backend to confirm chat requests are received.
6. Test:
   - Sending text message → works
   - Sending image message → works
   - No more 404 errors.

----------------------------------------------------
4. GENERAL STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------------------

- Remove duplicated variables (e.g., duplicate "theme", duplicate "renderMessage").
- Fix React warnings without changing functionality.
- Ensure hooks and callbacks follow correct patterns.
- Optimize AIChatScreen message rendering and scroll behavior.
- Update deprecated ImagePicker options to current standards.
- Build the app and ensure zero red-screen runtime errors.

----------------------------------------------------
5. FINAL VERIFICATION
----------------------------------------------------

After completing all steps:

- Test Home, AI Chat, and LiveAssist thoroughly.
- Test camera image uploads multiple times.
- Test gallery uploads.
- Test chat interactions with and without images.
- Check backend logs for correct route calls.
- Provide a written summary of what was fixed.

----------------------------------------------------

END OF TASK — Execute all steps above.
