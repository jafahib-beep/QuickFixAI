I want to do a final UI polish pass for QuickFix before V1 launch.

Important:
- Do NOT add new features.
- Do NOT change core logic, API calls, or navigation structure.
- Only improve visual layout, spacing, typography, and consistency.

Goals:
- Make the app look clean, modern, and consistent across all main screens:
  • Home
  • AI Chat
  • LiveAssist (including risk and spare-part cards)
  • Video Library (list + player)
  • Profile
  • Settings

Concrete tasks:

1. Bottom Tab Bar:
   - Ensure icons are consistent in size and style.
   - Align labels and use the same font size.
   - Use a clear active state (e.g. highlighted icon + label).
   - Order: Home, AI Chat, LiveAssist, Videos, Profile.

2. LiveAssist / Diagnosis UI:
   - Add consistent padding and margins around cards.
   - Use the same corner radius and shadow style for all cards.
   - Ensure sections (What I See, Likely Issue, Steps to Fix, Safety Note, RiskScanner, Spare Parts) have:
     • Clear headings
     • Consistent spacing between sections
   - On the image overlay view, ensure the image has enough padding and does not touch the screen edges.

3. Video Library:
   - Make video cards a consistent size (thumbnail + text).
   - Ensure category chips/tabs have consistent styling (padding, radius, active state).
   - On the video player screen, align title, category, and description with proper spacing.

4. Profile Screen:
   - Polish the Level/XP card:
     • Center content nicely
     • Clear "Level X" label
     • Progress bar aligned and not too tall
   - Align “Followers / Following / Uploads” row with equal spacing.
   - Make “Edit profile” button match the primary button style elsewhere.

5. Typography & Buttons:
   - Define a small set of font sizes (e.g. title, subtitle, body, caption) and apply them consistently.
   - Ensure primary buttons (e.g. main actions) share the same style:
     • Height
     • Corner radius
     • Font weight
   - Ensure secondary buttons (less important actions) use a consistent, lighter style.

6. Multilingual layout:
   - Quickly verify that the UI still looks correct for:
     • English (EN)
     • Swedish (SV)
     • Arabic (AR, RTL)
   - For Arabic, make sure text alignment and padding do not break the layout.

7. General spacing:
   - Add a bit more vertical spacing between major sections on all main screens so nothing feels cramped.
   - Avoid elements touching screen edges; keep a consistent horizontal margin.

Testing:
- Run the app in the preview.
- Navigate through all main screens:
  • Bottom tabs
  • LiveAssist results
  • Video Library
  • Profile
  • Settings
- Verify there are no visual glitches, overlaps, or cut-off text.

Please apply these UI/UX polish changes and show the main components you updated (screens and shared UI components).
