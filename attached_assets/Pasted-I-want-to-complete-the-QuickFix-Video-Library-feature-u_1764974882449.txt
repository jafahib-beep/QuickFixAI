I want to complete the QuickFix "Video Library" feature using a hybrid approach:
- 20 professional-looking dummy tutorial videos
- 5 real tutorials (YouTube videos that are legal to embed)

GOAL:
The Video Library must look full, professional, and ready for real users at launch.

TASKS:

1. DATA STRUCTURE
Create or update `src/data/videos.ts` to export an array of ~25 videos with:
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  category: string,
  thumbnail: string,
  url: string, // YouTube or placeholder MP4
  isReal: boolean
}

2. DUMMY VIDEOS (ABOUT 20 ITEMS)
Create well-written dummy entries with:
- High-quality thumbnails (placeholder URLs)
- Professional titles
- Diverse categories:
  - Plumbing
  - Electrical
  - Kitchen
  - Bathroom
  - DIY Basics
  - Maintenance
  - Safety
- Make the list feel rich and varied.

3. REAL VIDEOS (5 ITEMS)
Add 5 real YouTube tutorials that are allowed to embed. Use common home-repair tutorials, such as:
- Fix a leaking faucet
- Replace a shower hose
- Reset a tripped breaker safely
- Unclog a sink
- Repairing wall cracks

These should have:
- Real thumbnails from YouTube
- Real URLs
- Category + description

4. FRONTEND – VIDEO LIBRARY
Update the VideoLibraryScreen:
- Display videos grouped by categories
- Show thumbnails in a clean grid
- Support English, Swedish, and Arabic (RTL)
- Add a filter or tab bar for categories
- Make the screen visually appealing and not empty

5. VIDEO PLAYER SCREEN
Update or create `VideoPlayerScreen`:
- Show title, category, and the video player
- If it's YouTube: embed the YouTube player
- If it's dummy MP4: use Expo AV player
- Award XP via `awardXp(userId, "video_watch")`

6. HOME FEED INTEGRATION
On the Home screen:
- Add a "Recommended Videos" section that pulls from the library
- Add 4–8 random videos each load

7. MULTI-LANGUAGE POLISH
Add translations for:
- "Videos"
- Category names
- "Watch video"
- "Recommended"
- "Trending"
- "Real tutorial"
- "Dummy tutorial"
Ensure AR layout is correct.

8. UI QUALITY
Make the video library look PROFESSIONAL:
- Uniform card sizes
- Clean spacing
- Rounded corners
- Category labels
- Good padding and margins

9. FINAL TEST
Verify:
- All 25 videos show up correctly
- Categories filter works
- Video opens and awards XP
- Translations work for EN, SV, AR
- RTL layout for Arabic
- No missing keys

Please implement all of the above and show the key code changes.
