Implement a basic "Block User" system for the QuickFix app, mobile-first.

Important:
- Do NOT break existing auth, report system, or XP logic.
- Do NOT touch database initialization or global config more than necessary.
- Do NOT change core business logic or AI features.
- Web quirks can be ignored for now; focus on mobile (Expo) experience.

Goals:
1) A logged-in user can block another user from their profile.
2) Blocked users' content should be hidden from the blocker (feed, videos, comments if applicable).
3) Blocked users cannot follow or interact with the blocker anymore.
4) All UI text must support i18n (EN, SV, AR at minimum).

--- Backend ---

1. Data model:
   - Extend the User model to include:
     blockedUserIds: string[]   // list of user IDs that this user has blocked

   Make sure this is optional for existing users (initialize as empty array if missing).

2. Routes:

   Add the following authenticated endpoints:

   POST /api/block
     - Body: { targetUserId: string }
     - Behavior:
       • Get current authenticated user (request user).
       • If targetUserId is the same as current user, return an error.
       • If targetUserId is already in blockedUserIds, just return success.
       • Otherwise, push targetUserId into blockedUserIds for the current user and save.
       • Return { status: "ok" }.

   POST /api/unblock
     - Body: { targetUserId: string }
     - Behavior:
       • Remove targetUserId from blockedUserIds if present.
       • Return { status: "ok" }.

   GET /api/blocked
     - Return the list of blocked user IDs for the current user:
       { blockedUserIds: string[] }

3. Content filtering:

   Wherever feed / videos / profiles are fetched (e.g. video list, recommendations), apply a filter so that:
   - If the current user has blocked another user, that blocked user's content is not included in the results.
   - If feasible, also ensure that blocked users cannot see the blocker’s profile (e.g. by returning a generic “User not available” response when a blocked user tries to access it). Keep this part simple and safe.

   Keep the logic minimal and localized:
   - Prefer adding a helper like isBlocked(currentUser, targetUserId) and use it in the feed/profile endpoints.

4. Profile screen integration:

   On the Profile screen for OTHER users (not the logged-in user):
   - Add a "Block user" action with i18n text:
     EN: "Block user"
     SV: "Blockera användare"
     AR: "حظر المستخدم"

   - If the user is already blocked, show instead:
     EN: "Unblock user"
     SV: "Avblockera användare"
     AR: "إلغاء الحظر"

   - Tapping "Block user":
     • Show a confirmation dialog (Alert):
       EN: "Are you sure you want to block this user? You will no longer see their content."
       SV: "Är du säker på att du vill blockera den här användaren? Du kommer inte längre att se deras innehåll."
       AR: suitable Arabic translation.
     • On confirm, call POST /api/block with targetUserId.
     • On success, update local state so the button changes to "Unblock user".
     • Optionally show a toast/alert: 
       EN: "User blocked."
       SV: "Användaren har blockerats."
       AR: Arabic translation.

   - Tapping "Unblock user":
     • Similar flow, but calling POST /api/unblock.
     • Update state to show "Block user" again.

   Implement this using the existing API client in utils/api.ts so it stays consistent with the rest of the app.

5. UI behavior when user is blocked:

   - On a blocked profile:
     • Optionally show a short note such as:
       EN: "You have blocked this user."
       SV: "Du har blockerat den här användaren."
       AR: Arabic translation.
     • You can keep the rest of the profile minimal; main point is that the relationship is clear.

--- i18n ---

6. Add new i18n keys for:
   - Block user / Unblock user
   - Confirmation text
   - Success messages
   - "You have blocked this user."

   Ensure they are wired into the existing translation system (EN, SV, AR at minimum, others if already used).

--- Testing ---

7. Tests to perform (manually):

   - Log in as User A and open User B’s profile:
     • Tap "Block user" → confirm.
     • Check that:
       - User B’s content no longer appears in A’s feed.
       - Profile shows that the user is blocked.
     • Tap "Unblock user" → confirm.
       - User B’s content can appear again (assuming it matches normal feed rules).

   - Ensure the change does not break:
     • Existing profile actions.
     • XP/level display.
     • Report system.

Please keep the implementation clean, minimal and aligned with the current architecture (Node/Express backend and React Native/Expo frontend). Focus on mobile behavior; web-specific issues can be handled in a later iteration.
