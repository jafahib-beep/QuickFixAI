LiveAssist v2 is now working: 
- The user can take or select a photo.
- The backend uses GPT-4o Vision.
- The app displays a structured diagnosis (What I See, Likely Issue, Steps to Fix, Safety Note).
- Visual overlays highlight problem areas with numbered markers.

Now I want to extend this with a dedicated "RiskScanner AI" layer that focuses specifically on safety and structural risks.

Goal:
For every LiveAssist analysis, the AI should also:
- Detect potential safety and structural risks in the image.
- Return a clear risk level (Low, Medium, High).
- List specific risks (e.g. water near electrical components, mold, structural damage, fire hazard, unsafe tool usage).
- Optionally return overlays highlighting the dangerous areas in red.
- Provide concrete safety recommendations (e.g. "Do not attempt this repair yourself", "Turn off power at the breaker", "Wear gloves and mask", etc.).

Implementation approach:

1. Backend – extend /api/ai/liveassist response:
   - Keep the existing fields: summary, possible_issue, steps, safety_note, overlays.
   - Add new fields for RiskScanner:
     - `risk_level`: "low" | "medium" | "high"
     - `risk_summary`: short human-readable summary of the overall risk.
     - `risks`: an array of objects, e.g.:
       {
         "label": string,        // e.g. "Water near electrical outlet"
         "severity": "low" | "medium" | "high",
         "recommendation": string
       }
     - `riskOverlays`: optional array of overlay regions similar to the existing overlays, e.g.:
       {
         "x": number,
         "y": number,
         "width": number,
         "height": number,
         "riskLabel": string,
         "severity": "low" | "medium" | "high"
       }
   - Update the system prompt / instructions to the vision model so that, in addition to the normal diagnosis, it explicitly performs a safety/risk analysis:
     - Identify electrical risks, water leaks, mold, structural cracks, flammable materials, unsafe positioning of tools, etc.
     - Assign an overall risk level.
     - Return detailed risk entries and, where possible, associated overlay regions.

   - If `riskOverlays` cannot be reliably produced, the endpoint should still return `risk_level` and `risk_summary` and an empty riskOverlays array.

2. Frontend – LiveAssist result UI:
   - On the LiveAssist result screen, add a new "RiskScanner" / "Risk Assessment" section below the existing cards.
   - This section should:
     - Show a small header with an icon and the risk level (color-coded: green for low, yellow for medium, red for high).
     - Display the `risk_summary`.
     - List individual `risks` with their severity and recommendations.
   - For the image overlays:
     - Reuse the existing overlay rendering system.
     - Render risk overlays with a distinct red styling (e.g. semi-transparent red background and dashed border) so they are clearly different from the blue problem/repair overlays.
     - Optionally, show a small label near each risk overlay with the risk label or severity.

3. Behavior & UX:
   - RiskScanner should always run as part of LiveAssist analysis (no separate user action required for now).
   - If the backend returns `risk_level` and `risk_summary`, always show the RiskScanner section.
   - If risk data is missing or empty, hide the section gracefully without breaking the layout.
   - Existing text diagnosis and overlays must continue to work as before.

4. Code quality:
   - Update TypeScript types/interfaces on both client and server to include the new risk fields.
   - Keep the risk-related rendering encapsulated (for example, a dedicated RiskAssessment component).
   - Preserve localization support: make sure titles like "Risk Assessment", "Risk Level", "Low/Medium/High", and list labels go through the i18n system.

Please:
- Scan the current LiveAssist backend and frontend implementation.
- Implement the risk analysis fields in the backend, including the updated AI prompt.
- Implement the RiskScanner UI section and risk overlays on the frontend.
- Show the key code changes.
- Test with at least one image that clearly contains a risk (e.g. water damage near a pipe, mold, or exposed wiring) and verify that:
  - A risk level is shown.
  - At least one risk entry is listed.
  - Risk overlays appear in red on the image when provided.
