I want to do a focused UI cleanup pass for QuickFix, **mobile-first**.

Important:
- Do NOT change business logic, API calls, or database.
- Do NOT touch the report system logic (only visual alignment if needed).
- Web quirks (especially the report button on web) are out of scope for now. Prioritize mobile (Expo) experience.
- Only adjust layout, spacing, typography, and visual consistency for the mobile app.

Goals:
- Make the app feel like a polished, production-ready mobile app.
- Ensure all main screens look clean in English, Swedish, and Arabic (RTL).

Please:

1. Bottom Tab Bar
   - Ensure icons are consistent in size and alignment.
   - Labels use the same font size and padding.
   - The active tab is clearly highlighted (icon + label).
   - Confirm order: Home, AI Chat, LiveAssist, Videos/Community, Profile.

2. Home / Feed Screen
   - Check spacing between sections: “Recommended”, “New”, etc.
   - Ensure video cards have consistent size, padding, and corner radius.
   - Make sure text (titles, tags, durations) does not feel cramped.

3. LiveAssist Screen
   - Make the main layout look clean:
     • Image area with enough padding.
     • Sections: “What I See”, “Likely Issue”, “Steps to Fix”, “Safety Note”, “Risks”, “Spare Parts”.
   - Use consistent card styles (radius, shadow, background).
   - Ensure step numbers are aligned and easy to read.

4. Video Library + Video Player
   - Make the video cards in the library grid/list visually consistent:
     • Same thumbnail aspect ratio.
     • Same padding, radius, spacing.
   - On the player screen:
     • Align title, category, and action buttons (like/report).
     • Make the report button visually consistent but do not change its logic.
   - Ensure text does not overflow and is truncated nicely if too long.

5. Profile Screen
   - Polish the Level / XP card:
     • Center the content.
     • Clear Level label and XP progress bar.
     • “XP to next level” text aligned properly.
   - Align followers / following / uploads row with equal spacing.
   - Make the “Edit profile” button use the same primary button style as elsewhere.

6. Settings / Legal Screens
   - Ensure links to:
     • Community Guidelines
     • Terms of Use
     • Privacy Policy
     are clearly visible, properly spaced and tappable.
   - Make text blocks readable with proper line spacing and margins.

7. Typography & Buttons
   - Define and apply a small set of text styles:
     • Title / Section header
     • Subtitle
     • Body text
     • Caption / meta
   - Ensure primary buttons (main actions) share the same:
     • Height
     • Corner radius
     • Font weight
     • Padding
   - Ensure secondary buttons (less important actions) have a lighter, consistent style.

8. Multi-language & RTL (mobile)
   - Quickly test the key screens in:
     • English
     • Swedish
     • Arabic (RTL)
   - Fix any layout issues caused by RTL:
     • Text alignment
     • Padding/margins on the left/right
   - Ensure nothing overlaps or gets cut off when switching languages.

9. General polish
   - Avoid elements touching screen edges – keep a consistent horizontal margin.
   - Add a bit more vertical spacing between large sections if needed.
   - Ensure scrolling works smoothly on all major screens.

After implementing, please:
- Run the app on mobile preview (Expo).
- Navigate through: Home, AI Chat, LiveAssist, Videos, Profile, Settings.
- Show me the key components/screens you changed (file names and a brief summary).
