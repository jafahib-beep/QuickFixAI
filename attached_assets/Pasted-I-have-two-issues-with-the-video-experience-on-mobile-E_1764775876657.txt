I have two issues with the video experience on mobile (Expo):

1) On the video cards, I have to tap on the text/title to open the video. Tapping on the thumbnail or play icon does nothing.
2) When the VideoPlayerScreen opens, I only see a black screen with no video and no sound.

Please fix both problems:

A) Make the whole video card tappable
1. Update the VideoCard component so that:
   - The entire card (including thumbnail, play icon, and text) is wrapped in a Pressable or Touchable.
   - Tapping anywhere on the card should trigger the same handler that opens the VideoPlayerScreen.
   - The play icon overlay should also use the same onPress handler.
2. Verify that on Home, category feeds, tag feeds, search results, and Toolbox, tapping on a video card opens the player reliably.

B) Fix the VideoPlayerScreen so videos actually play on mobile
1. Check the sample videoUrl values:
   - Make sure they point to a valid, publicly reachable HTTPS MP4 URL (not localhost or a dev-only path).
   - For now, you can reuse one or a few demo MP4 URLs so that all sample videos are playable on a physical device.
2. In VideoPlayerScreen.tsx:
   - Use the Video component from expo-av with a proper style (so it has visible height/width).
   - Make sure the Video has:
       * source={{ uri: videoUrl }}
       * useNativeControls={true}
       * resizeMode set appropriately
   - Ensure the video is not permanently paused or muted unless the user chooses that.
3. Add a simple loading indicator (spinner or text) while the video is buffering, so the user knows something is happening.
4. Test on a real device via Expo:
   - Tapping a video card opens the VideoPlayerScreen.
   - The video loads and starts playing (with controls and sound).
   - There is no permanent black screen.

The goal: 
- Any visible video card should be easy to tap (thumbnail/play area).
- When a video opens, it should show real video content and audio on mobile, not just a black screen.
