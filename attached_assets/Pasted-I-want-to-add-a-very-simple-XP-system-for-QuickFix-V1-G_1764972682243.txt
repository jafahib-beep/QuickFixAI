I want to add a very simple XP system for QuickFix V1.

Goal:
- Users earn XP for a few core actions:
  - Sending a message in AI Chat
  - Running a LiveAssist scan (image analysis)
  - Watching a video from the Video Library
- XP is stored per user in the backend.
- A simple "level" is derived from XP (for example Level 1–5 for V1).
- On the Profile screen, the user can see:
  - Their current level
  - Their total XP
  - How much XP is needed to reach the next level
  - A simple progress bar (no leaderboards or ranks yet)

This should be minimal and robust, not over-engineered.

Implementation details:

1. Backend – data model:

   - Extend the User model (in the existing database) with:
     - `xp` (integer, default 0)
     - `level` (integer, default 1)

   - Add a simple leveling rule, for example:
     - Level 1: 0–99 XP
     - Level 2: 100–249 XP
     - Level 3: 250–499 XP
     - Level 4: 500–999 XP
     - Level 5: 1000+ XP
   - Implement a small helper function, e.g. `calculateLevelFromXp(xp: number): number`, so we can reuse it everywhere.

2. Backend – XP rewards logic:

   - Create a small service/helper, e.g. `awardXp(userId, actionType)` where `actionType` is something like:
     - `"ai_chat_message"`
     - `"liveassist_scan"`
     - `"video_watch"`
   - Inside this helper, define constants for XP rewards, for example:
     - `AI_CHAT_XP = 5`
     - `LIVEASSIST_XP = 10`
     - `VIDEO_WATCH_XP = 3`
   - The helper should:
     - Load the user
     - Add the correct XP amount
     - Recompute the level using `calculateLevelFromXp`
     - Save the user

   - Hook this helper into existing flows:
     - When a user successfully sends an AI Chat message and receives a valid AI response, call `awardXp(userId, "ai_chat_message")`.
     - When a LiveAssist scan completes successfully (image analyzed and response returned), call `awardXp(userId, "liveassist_scan")`.
     - When a video is watched (for V1 it is enough to call it when the user opens the video player screen), call `awardXp(userId, "video_watch")`.

3. Backend – API for profile / XP info:

   - Make sure the `me`/profile endpoint (or similar) returns:
     - `xp`
     - `level`
     - Optionally `nextLevelXp` (how much XP is needed for the next level) so the frontend can show a progress bar easily.
   - Example structure:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "...",
       "name": "...",
       "xp": 135,
       "level": 2,
       "nextLevelXp": 200
     }
     ```

4. Frontend – Profile screen XP UI:

   - On the Profile screen, add a simple XP/Level section near the top.
   - Show:
     - A label like "Level 2"
     - A sublabel like "135 / 200 XP"
     - A horizontal progress bar that fills based on `xp / nextLevelXp`.
   - For now, keep the design minimal but clean (no badges, no rank icons, no leaderboards).

   - Also:
     - Ensure texts such as "Level", "XP", "Next level" and any small descriptions use the existing i18n / localization system (at least Swedish and English).

5. Behavior:

   - XP should only be awarded for successful actions (not for failed calls).
   - Make sure the XP update is not blocking the main functionality; if the XP update fails, the core feature (chat, scan, video) should still work.
   - No need for history of every XP event in V1; only the cumulative XP is needed.

6. Code quality:

   - Update TypeScript types/interfaces for the user where relevant (both frontend and backend).
   - Keep the XP/level logic isolated in a helper/service so it can be extended later (for ranks, badges, etc.).
   - Add a couple of basic checks or logs to avoid XP exploding due to repeated calls.

Please:
- Scan the current user model and auth/profile API.
- Implement the xp + level fields, the `awardXp` helper, and integrate it into AI Chat, LiveAssist, and Video Library flows.
- Implement the Profile UI section for XP and Level.
- Show the key code changes.
- Test with a real user flow:
  - Send a chat message → XP increases.
  - Run a LiveAssist scan → XP increases.
  - Open a video → XP increases.
  - Refresh the Profile screen and verify that the level and XP/progress bar update correctly.
