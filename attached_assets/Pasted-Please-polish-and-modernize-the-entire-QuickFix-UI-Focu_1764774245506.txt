Please polish and modernize the entire QuickFix UI. 
Focus on visual design only – do NOT change business logic, navigation logic, or API calls.

Goals:
- The app should look like a clean, modern short-video app (similar to TikTok/Instagram Reels), but with our QuickFix identity.
- Consistent dark theme with a primary blue accent.

Please do:

1) Global styling
   - Standardize font sizes, weights, and colors across all screens.
   - Use consistent spacing (padding/margins) so elements are not cramped.
   - Ensure buttons and cards have consistent border radius and subtle shadows.
   - Make headings (like “Rekommenderat”, “Nytt”) visually clear and aligned.

2) HomeScreen
   - Improve layout of the header and category chips bar.
   - Make category chips look like polished pills: padding, active state, hover/touch feedback.
   - Improve video card layout: thumbnail area, title, creator, tags, like/save icons, duration.
   - Make sure the Recommended and New sections have proper spacing and look balanced.

3) CategoryFeedScreen & TagFeedScreen
   - Apply the same polished video card design here.
   - Add clear titles/subtitles for the selected category or tag.
   - Ensure scrolling feels smooth and visually consistent with the Home feed.

4) CategoriesScreen
   - Make the grid of categories visually appealing:
     * icons + labels centered,
     * even spacing,
     * clear tap feedback.

5) SearchScreen
   - Clean up the search bar styling and results list.
   - Use the same video card style for search results.
   - Make empty/“no results” states look friendly and on-brand.

6) ToolboxScreen
   - Make saved videos list clean and consistent with other feeds.
   - Clarify tabs/sections for saved content if needed.
   - Add a friendly empty state when there are no saved items.

7) ProfileScreen
   - Improve layout:
     * user avatar, name, stats (followers, following, uploads),
     * tabs for Uploads and Saved.
   - Use the same polished video cards in the lists.

8) UploadScreen
   - Make the form clean and easy to understand:
     * clear labels for title, description, category, tags,
     * good spacing between fields,
     * a clear primary button.
   - Keep existing AI logic, only improve visuals.

9) SettingsScreen
   - Make the settings list visually consistent and easy to scan.
   - Highlight important actions (Language, Log out) with proper spacing and icons.

10) Loading states
   - Where possible, use subtle loading indicators or skeleton placeholders instead of abrupt empty screens.

Again: do not change how navigation or data fetching works – only visual styling and layout.
