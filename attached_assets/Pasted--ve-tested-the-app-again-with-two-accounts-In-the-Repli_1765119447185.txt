’ve tested the app again with two accounts:

In the Replit web preview, the Community feed works:
I can see posts and comments from both test accounts.

On my physical phone (Expo Go), using the same backend, I do not see the same posts/comments, even after pull-to-refresh.

This means:

Backend and database are OK.

The mobile app Community screen is still using stale data, wrong fetch logic, or some caching/fallback that is different from the web preview.

I need you to:

A. Make the Community feed identical on mobile and web

Ensure that the React Native app (AIChatScreen / Community screens / CommunityContext) always loads posts and comments only from the real backend:

GET /api/community for posts

the real comments endpoint for comments

Remove or disable any remaining:

sample data

local “offline” fallback

in-memory arrays that might be used instead of the API response

Make sure pull-to-refresh on the Community tab:

actually calls GET /api/community

replaces the current list with the latest data from the backend

After your changes, please verify this with two real accounts:

Account A creates a post → Account B can see it on mobile after refresh.

Account B comments on A’s post → both accounts see the comment on mobile and web.

Please add clear console logs for the mobile fetch calls, e.g. [MOBILE] Fetching /api/community and [MOBILE] Received N posts, so I can see in the Replit console that the phone really hits the backend.

B. Make post authors and commenters tappable → open profile

Right now, in the Community feed:

I see the author’s name/avatar,

but I cannot tap it to open their profile or add them as a friend.

I need you to:

Make the author name / avatar on posts and comments tappable.

When tapped:

Navigate to the existing User Profile screen for that user (the one that shows followers, uploads, XP, etc.).

Make sure it receives the correct userId so it shows the selected user, not just my own profile.

On that profile screen, ensure there is a clear action like:

“Follow” / “Add friend” button, if that system already exists,

or at least prepare the navigation/hook so we can easily attach friend/follow logic later.

Please:

List the files you changed.

Explain briefly how you fixed:

mobile Community feed (so it shows the same data as web),

profile navigation from posts/comments.

Confirm that you tested with two accounts on a physical device (Expo Go) and that both see each other’s posts/comments.
